- Shop system to sell crops
- Logic for shop system
	- When you are in the shop circle, set a bool to true like inCircle = true
	- Make ui appear thats like "press e to open shop"
		- can only open shop if inCircle = true
	- E opens shop menu
		- shop menu will haaaave.....
		- Crop 1 Sell price: 7 (2 profit)
		- Crop 2 Sell price: 20 (5 profit) x3
		- Crop 3 Sell price: 60 (15 profit) x3
		- Crop 4 Sell price: 180 (45 profit) x3
		- bright green sell button after each row
	- X in corner to close shop
- Saves over restarts? Not really needed for grade but if I feel like it I can do it
